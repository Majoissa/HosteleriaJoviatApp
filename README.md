# HosteleriaJoviatApp
## Welcome to Hosteler√≠a Joviat Application
##### The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application suitable for Android and IOS, aimed at generating a contact network between Joviat school students and alumni of the same school, who have worked or are working in certain restaurants.
It is intended that current students can communicate with already graduated students to obtain information about the restaurant.
It will have a main activity in which you can choose the view between two options: map view, or list view where you can see the restaurants. The user can select a restaurant, and see the information about said restaurant on a new screen, where they can see its location and contact information. If the user is registered in the app (they must be joviat students registered by the establishment's administration), they will also be able to see contact information for the former students in case they want to contact them.
